## Working with Data
- "Names, X to II" is dedicated to my grandmother, Irinka Nedyalkova
## Data is on a journey, we are just the companions
I had experienced the Midnight Sun, walked on the North Sea at ebb tide, travelled with high-speed trains Shinkansen, got lost at Taj Mahal, flew with air balloons and aircrafts, yet Data is the most amazing journey of my life! We never know where the Data is going to take us...
