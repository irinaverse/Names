## Working with Data
- "Names, X to II" is dedicated to my grandmother, Irinka Nedyalkova
- separate datasets for male names and female names
- making ABC dictionary to pandas dataframe
- transiting through dataframes
- data visualization as bar graphs in Matplotlib
- for myself "X to II" means something unknown becomes known, and is connected to the initials in the project
- what means "X to II" to you?
